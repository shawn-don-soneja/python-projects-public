## Welcome!

In my [`projects`](/projects) folder, you'll find two projects:
1. [ChatGPT LTSM](https://github.com/shawn-don-soneja/python-projects-public/tree/main/projects/Chat%20GPT__LTSM%20Prediction) | This project demonstrates a **Long-term Short Memory** prediction model in action, using the `keras` library. As evidenced, I got some LLM-support for this project; I was able to produce LTSM predictions against stock data.

2. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/shawn-don-soneja/python-projects-public/tree/main/projects/Linear%20Regression) | This project demonstrates a **Linear Regression** model, from the `scikit-learn` library.
